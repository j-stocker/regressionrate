# Regression Rate Analyzer from VisIt `.xyz` Export

This project automates the visualization and analysis of regression (burn) rates using data exported from VisIt. The code generates contour plots of a scalar field (`eta`) and calculates how far it propagates over time to compute **instantaneous** and **average regression rates**.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Visualization Setup in VisIt**

A contour plot of the surface where eta = 0.5 is created and visualized.

### 2. **Data Extraction**

A .xyz file is created for each time step with coordinates of the created contour.
From each `.xyz` file:

* The **second column** (representing `x` coordinates) is extracted.
* For each file, it computes:

  * Maximum `x` position
  * Average `x` position

These are saved to `results.txt`.

### 3. **Regression Rate Computation**

Using `results.txt`:

* Instantaneous burn rate is calculated via forward difference.
* Overall average burn rate is calculated from first and last data points.
* The average burn rate of the furthest x coordinate is calculated from first and last data points.

All results are saved to `burn_rates.txt`.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ eta_coords/              # Exported XYZ files (one per time step)
â”œâ”€â”€ results.txt              # Time vs Max/Avg X values
â”œâ”€â”€ burn_rates.txt           # Final regression rate results
â”œâ”€â”€ export_eta_data.py       # VisIt script to generate plots & export data
â”œâ”€â”€ analyze_regression.py    # Python script for post-processing
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸ›  Requirements

* **VisIt** (for plot generation and export)
* **Python 3.6+**

  * No external libraries required (only uses `os` and `csv`)

## How to Run

### Step 1: Export `.xyz` files from VisIt

Run the VisIt script (`xcoords.py`) from within the VisIt GUI or CLI.
(Copy and paste into the Command window.)

This script:

* Adds a contour plot of the `eta` variable
* Applies a custom discrete color palette
* Iterates over all timesteps
* Exports `.xyz` files into a folder `./eta_coords/`

### Step 2: Run the analysis

Once `.xyz` files are generated:

```bash
python reg_rate.py
```

This will:

* Generate `results.txt` (max/avg x positions over time)
* Generate `burn_rates.txt` with burn rate calculations
